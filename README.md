I'm a Java Champion and Sr. Principal Developer Advocate at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com), focusing on Application Development technologies such as [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io), [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), as well as the rest of [Red Hat's Runtimes portfolio](https://www.redhat.com/en/products/runtimes). I help create technical content within https://github.com/RedHat-Middleware-Workshops. I'm also the primary maintainer of the [Quarkus Superheroes](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-super-heroes), the official sample application for [Quarkus](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus).

Prior to joining Red Hat, I spent many years in the financial services & insurance industries. I also enjoy contributing to various open source project, including my own [XJC Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/edeandrea/xjc-generation-gradle-plugin).

Outside of work, I enjoy ice hockey and martial arts. I hold a black belt in Kempo Karate. I'm also a board member of the [Boston Java Users ACM Chapter](https://www.meetup.com/nejug1).

I've recently published a book - [Quarkus for Spring Developers](https://red.ht/quarkus-spring-devs). This book is a Spring Developer's ultimate resource to learn about [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io) and Kubernetes-native Java. It showcases and explains how Quarkus enables modern Java development and the Kubernetes-native experience. Get introductions to familiar Spring concepts, constructs, and conventions [through equivalent code examples](https://github.com/quarkus-for-spring-developers/examples), then learn how they map to Quarkus. It additionally places emphasis on testing patterns and practices.
